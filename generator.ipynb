symbola one minute readout from  the  face  of  a  modern  digital  watchis  intended  to remind  each  of  us  to take a  minute out of  our  day to  look into the faces of the people we manage And to realize that they are our most important resources 8 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The One Minute Manager Introduction In  this  brief  story  we  present  you  with  a  great  deal  of  what  we  have  learned  from  our studies in medicine and in the behavioral sciences about how people work best with other people By  “best”  we  mean  how  people  produce  valuable  results  and  feel  good  about themselves the organization and the other people with whom they work This allegory  The One Minute Manager  is a simple compilation of what  many wise people have taught us and what we have learned ourselves We recognize the importance of these  sources of wisdom  We also realize that the people who work with  you as their manager will look to you as one of  their sources of wisdom We trust therefore that you will take the practical knowledge you gain from this book and use it in your daily management For as the ancient sage Confucius advises each of us “The essence of knowledge is having it to use it” We hope you enjoy  using what you learn from  The One Minute Manager  and that as a result  you  and  the  people  you  work  with  will  enjoy  healthier  happier  and  more productive lives Kenneth Blanchard PhD Spencer Johnson MD 9 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The Search ONCE there was a bright young man who was looking for an effective manager He wanted to work for one He wanted to become one His search had taken him over many years to the far corners of the world He had been in small towns and in the capitals of powerful nations He  had  spoken  with  many  managers  with  government  administrators  and  military officers construction superintendents and corporate executives university presidents and shop  foremen  utility  supervisors  and  foundation  directors  with  the  managers  of  shops and stores of restaurants banks and hotels with men and womenyoung and old He  had  gone  into  every  kind  of  office  large  and  small  luxurious  and  sparse  with windows and without He was beginning to see the full spectrum of how people manage people But he wasn’t always pleased with what he saw He  had  seen  many  “tough”  managers whose organizations seemed to win while their people lost Some of their superiors thought they were good managers Many of their subordinates thought otherwise As  the  man  sat  in  each  of  these  “tough people’s”  offices  he  asked  “What  kind  of  a manager would you say you are” Their answers varied only slightly “I’m an autocratic managerI keep on top of the situation” he was told “A bottomline manager” “Hardnosed” “Realistic” “Profitminded” He heard the pride in their voices and their interest in results The  man  also  met  many  “nice”  managers  whose  people  seemed  to  win  while  their organizations lost Some of the people who reported to them thought they were good managers Those to whom they reported had their doubts As the man sat and listened to these “nice” people answer the same question he heard “I’m  a  democratic  manager”  “Participative”  “Supportive”  “Considerate” “Humanistic” He heard the pride in their voices and their interest in people But he was disturbed It was as though most managers in the world were primarily interested either in results or in people The  managers who were  interested in results often seemed to be  labeled  “autocratic” while the managers interested in people were often labeled “democratic” The young man thought each of these managersthe “tough” autocrat and the “nice” democratwere only partially effective “It’s like being half a manager” he thought He returned home tired and discouraged He might have given up his search long ago but he had one great advantage He knew exactly what he was looking for “Effective managers” he thought “manage themselves and the people they work with so that both the organization and the people profit from their presence” 10 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The young man had looked everywhere for an effective manager but had found only a few The few he did find would not share their secrets with him He began to think maybe he would never find out what really made an effective manager tick Then  he  began  hearing  marvelous  stories  about  a  special  manager  who  lived ironically in a nearby town He heard that people liked to work for this man and that they produced great results together The young  man wondered  if the stories were really true and if so whether this manager would be willing to share his secrets with him Curious  he  telephoned  the  special  manager’s  secretary  for  an  appointment  The secretary put him through immediately The  young  man  asked  this  special  manager when  he could  see  him He  heard  “Any time this week is fine except Wednesday morning You pick the time” The young man quietly chuckled because this supposedly marvelous manager sounded like  a  “kook”  to  him  What  kind  of  manager  had  that  kind  of  time  available  But  the young man was fascinated He went to see him 11 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The One Minute Manager WHEN  the  young  man  arrived  at  the  manager’s  office  he  found  him  standing  and looking  out  of  the  window  When  the  young  man  coughed  the  manager  turned  and smiled He invited the young man to sit down and asked “What can I do for you” The  young  man  said  “I’d  like  to  ask  you  some  questions  about  how  you  manage people” The manager willingly said “Fire away” “Well  to  begin  with  do  you  hold  regularly  scheduled  meetings  with  your subordinates” “Yes  I  doonce  a  week  on  Wednesdays  from  900  to  1100  That’s  why I  couldn’t see you then” responded the manager “What do you do at those meetings” probed the young man “I  listen  while  my  people  review  and  analyze  what they  accomplished  last week the problems they had and what still needs to be accomplished Then we develop plans and strategies for the next week” “Are  the  decisions  made  at  those  meetings  binding  on  both  you  and  your  people” questioned the young man “Of  course  they  are”  insisted  the  manager  “What  would  be  the  point  of  having  the meeting if they weren’t” “Then you are a participative manager aren’t you” asked the young man “On the contrary” insisted the manager “I don’t believe in participating in any of my people’s decisionmaking” “Then what is the purpose of your meetings” “I already told you that” he said “Please young man do not ask me to repeat myself It is a waste of my time and yours “We’re here to get results” the manager continued “The purpose of this organization is efficiency By being organized we are a great deal more productive” “Oh so  you’re aware of the  need  for productivity Then  you’re  more resultsoriented than peopleoriented” the young man suggested “No” the manager resounded startling his visitor “I hear that all too often” He got to his  feet  and  began  to  walk  about  “How  on  earth  can  I  get  results  if  it’s  not  through people I care about people and results They go hand in hand “Here  young  man  look at this” The  manager  handed  his  visitor a plaque  “I keep  it on my desk to remind me of a practical truth” 12 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER ê People Who Feel Good About Themselves Produce Good Results ê 13 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER As  the  young  man  looked  at  the  plaque  the  manager  said  “Think  about  yourself When do you work best Is it when you feel good about yourself Or when you don’t” The  young  man  nodded  as  he  began  to  see  the obvious  “I  get  more  done  when  I’m feeling good about myself” he responded “Of course you do” the manager agreed “And so does everyone else” The young man raised his index finger with newfound insight “So” he said “helping people to feel good about themselves is a key to getting more done” “Yes”  the  manager  agreed  “However  remember  productivity  is  more  than  just  the quantity  of  work  done  It  is  also  the   quality”  He  walked  over  to  the  window  and  said “Come over here young man” He pointed to the traffic  below  and asked  “Do  you see how  many foreign cars there are on the road” The young man looked out at the real world and said “I see more of them every day And I guess that’s because they’re more economical and they last longer” The  manager  nodded  reluctantly  and  said  “Exactly  So  why  do  you  think  people  are buying  foreign  cars  Because  American  manufacturers  did  not  make   enough  cars  Or” the  manager  said  without  interrupting  “because  they  did  not  make  the   quality  car  the American public really wanted “Now  that  I  think  of  it”  the  young  man  answered  “it’s  a  question  of   quality  and quantity” “Of  course”  the  manager  added  “Quality  is  simply  giving  people  the  product  or service they really want and need” The  older  man  stood  at the  window  lost  in  his thoughts He  could  remember  not  so long  ago  when  his  country  provided  the  technology  that  helped  to  rebuild  Europe  and Asia It still amazed him that America had fallen so far behind in productivity The young  man  broke the  manager’s concentration “I’m reminded of an ad I saw on television”  the  visitor  volunteered  “It  showed  the  name  of  the  foreign  car  and  over  it came the words  If you’re going to take out a longterm car loan don’t buy a shortterm car” The  manager turned and  said quietly “I’m  afraid that’s a rather good summary  And that’s the whole point Productivity is both quantity and quality” The manager and his visitor began to walk back towards the couch “And frankly the best way to achieve both of these results is through people” The young man’s interest increased As he sat down he asked “Well you’ve already said that you’re not a participative manager Just how would you describe  yourself” “That’s easy” he responded without hesitation “I’m a One Minute Manager” The  young  man’s  face showed surprise He’d never heard of a One Minute Manager “You’re a what” The  manager  laughed  and  said  “I’m  a  One  Minute  Manager  I  call  myself  that because it takes very little time for me to get very big results from people” Although  the  young  man  had  spoken  with  many  managers  he  had  never  heard  one talk  like  this  It  was  hard  to  believe  A One  Minute Managersomeone  who  gets  good results without taking much time Seeing the doubt on  his  face the manager said  “You don’t believe  me do you You don’t believe that I’m a One Minute Manager” “I must admit it’s hard for me even to imagine” the young man responded 14 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The  manager  laughed  and  said  “Listen  you’d  better  talk  to  my  people  if  you  really want to know what kind of manager I am” The  manager  leaned  over  and  spoke  into  the  office  intercom  His  secretary  Ms Metcalfe came in moments later and handed the young man a sheet of paper “Those  are  the  names  positions  and  phone  numbers  of  the  six  people  who  report to me” the One Minute Manager explained “Which ones should I talk to” the young man asked “That’s  your  decision”  the  manager  responded  “Pick any  name  Talk  to any one  of them or all of them” “Well I mean who should I start with” “I already told you I don’t make decisions for other people” the manager said firmly “Make that decision yourself” He stood up and walked his visitor towards the door “You have asked me not once but twice to make a simple decision for you Frankly young man I find that annoying Do not ask me to repeat myself Either pick a name and get started or take your search for effective management elsewhere” The  visitor  was  stunned  He  was  uncomfortable  very  uncomfortable  A  moment  of embarrassed silence seemed like an eternity Then the One Minute Manager looked the young man in the eye and said “You want to know about managing people and I admire that” He shook his visitor’s hand “If  you  have  any  questions  after  talking  to  some  of  my  people”  he  said  warmly “come  back  and  see  me  I  appreciate  your interest  and  desire to  learn  how to manage  I would  in  fact  like  to  give  you  the  concept  of  the  One  Minute  Manager  as  a  gift Someone  gave  it  to  me  once  and  it’s  made  all  the  difference  to  me  I  want  you  to understand  it  fully  If  you  like  it  you  may  want  to  become  a  One  Minute  Manager yourself someday” “Thank you” the young man managed He  left the  manager’s office somewhat dumbfounded As he passed the secretary  she said  understandingly  “I  can  see  from  your  dazed  look  that  you’ve  already  experienced our One Minute Manager” The young man said very slowly still trying to figure things out “I guess I have” “Maybe I can help you” Ms Metcalfe said “I’ve phoned the six people who report to him Five of them are here and they have each agreed to see you You may be better able to understand our ‘One Minute Manager’ after you’ve spoken with them” The young man thanked her looked over the list and decided to talk to three of them Mr Trenell Mr Levy and Ms Brown 15 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The First Secret One Minute Goals WHEN the young man arrived at Trenell’s office he found a middleaged man smiling at him “Well you’ve been to see the ‘ole man’ He’s quite a guy isn’t he” “He seems that way” the young man responded “Did he tell you about being a One Minute Manager” “He sure did It’s not true is it” asked the young man “You’d better believe it is I hardly ever see him” “You mean you never get any help from him” puzzled the young man “Essentially very little although he does spend some time with me at the beginning of a new task or responsibility That’s when he does One Minute Goal Setting” “One Minute Goal Setting  What’s that”  said the  young  man “He told me  he was a One Minute Manager but he didn’t say anything about One Minute Goal Setting” “That’s the first of the three secrets to One Minute Management” Trenell answered “Three secrets” the young man asked wanting to know more “Yes” said Trenell  “One  Minute Goal Setting is the first one and the  foundation  for One Minute Management You see in most organizations when you ask people what they do  and  then  ask  their  boss  all  too  often  you  get  two  different  lists  In  fact  in  some organizations  I’ve  worked  in  any  relationship  between  what  I  thought  my  job responsibilities were and what my boss thought they were was purely coincidental And then I would get in trouble for not doing something I didn’t even think was my job” “Does that ever happen here” asked the young man “No” Trenell said “It never happens here The One Minute Manager always makes it clear what our responsibilities are and what we are being held accountable for” “Just how does he do that” the young man wanted to know “Efficiently” Trenell said with a smile Trenell  began  to  explain  “Once  he  has  told  me  what  needs  to  be  done  or  we  have agreed  on  what  needs  to  be  done  then  each  goal  is  recorded  on  no  more  than  a  single page  The  One  Minute  Manager  feels  that  a  goal  and  its  performance  standard  should take no more than 250 words to express He insists that anyone be able to read it within a minute  He  keeps  a  copy  and  I  keep  a  copy  so  everything  is  clear  and  so  we  can  both periodically check the progress “Do you have these onepage statements for every goal” “Yes” answered Trenell “Well wouldn’t there be a lot of these onepage statements for each person” “No  there  really  aren’t”  Trenell  insisted  “The  old  man  believes  in  the  8020  goalsetting  rule  That  is  80  of  your  really  important  results  will  come  from  20  of  your goals  So  we  only  do  One  Minute  Goal  Setting  on  that  20  that  is  our  key  areas  of responsibilitymaybe  three  to  six goals  in  all  Of  course  in  the  event a special  project comes up we set special One Minute Goals” “Interesting” the young man commented “I think I understand the importance of One Minute Goal Setting It sounds like a philosophy of ‘no surprises’everyone knows what is expected from the beginning” “Exactly” Trenell nodded 16 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “So is One Minute Goal Setting just understanding what your responsibilities are” the young man asked “No Once we know what our job  is the manager always  makes  sure we know what good performance is In other words performance standards are clear He shows us what he expects” “How does he do thatshow you what he expects” asked the young man “Let me give you an example” Trenell suggested “One of my One Minute Goals was this Identify performance problems and come up with solutions which when implemented will turn the situation around “When  I  first  came  to  work  here  I spotted  a problem  that  needed  to  be  solved  but  I didn’t  know  what  to  do  So  I  called  the  One  Minute  Manager  When  he  answered  the phone I said  Sir I have a problem Before I could get another word out he said  Good That’s what you’ve been hired to solve Then there was a dead silence on the other end of the phone “I didn’t know what to do The silence was deafening I eventually stuttered out  But but Sir I don’t know how to solve this problem “Trenell he said  one of your goals for the future is for you to identify and solve your own problems But since you are new come on up and we’ll talk “When  I  got  up there  he  said  Tell  me  Trenell what  your  problem  isbut  put it  in behavioral terms “Behavioral terms I echoed  What do you mean by behavioral terms “I mean the manager explained to me  that I do not want to hear about only attitudes or feelings Tell me what is happening in observable measurable terms “I described the problem the best I could “He  said  That’s  good  Trenell Now tell  me  what you  would  like  to  be happening  in behavioral terms “I don’t know I said “Then don’t waste my time he snapped “I just froze in amazement for a few seconds I didn’t know what to do He mercifully broke the dead silence “If  you  can’t  tell  me  what  you’d  like  to  be  happening  he  said  you  don’t  have  a problem  yet  You’re  just  complaining  A  problem  only  exists  if  there  is  a  difference between what is  actually  happening and what you  desire  to be happening “Being  a  quick  learner  I  suddenly  realized  I  knew  what  I  wanted  to  be  happening After  I  told  him  he  asked  me  to  talk  about  what  may  have  caused  the  discrepancy between the actual and the desired “After that the One Minute Manager said  Well what are you going to do about it” “Well I could do A I said “If you did A would what you want to happen actually happen he asked “No I said “Then you have a lousy solution What else could you do he asked “I could do B I said “But if you do B will what you want to happen really happen he countered again “No I realized “Then that’s also a bad solution he said  What else can you do 17 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “I thought about it for a couple of minutes and said  I could do C But if I do C what I want to happen won’t happen so that is a bad solution isn’t it “Right  You’re  starting  to  come  around  the  manager  then  said  with  a  smile  on  his face  Is there anything else you could do he asked “Maybe I could combine some of these solutions I said “That sounds worth trying he reacted “In fact if I do A this week B next week and C in two weeks I’ll have it solved That’s fantastic Thanks so much You solved my problem for me “He got very annoyed  I did not he interrupted  you solved it yourself I just asked you questionsquestions you are able to ask yourself Now get out of here and start solving your own problems on your time not mine “I knew what he had done of course He’d shown me how to solve problems so that I could do it on my own in the future “Then  he  stood  looked  me  straight  in  the  eye  and  said  You’re  good  Trenell Remember that the next time you have a problem “I remember smiling as I left his office” Trenell  leaned  back  in  his  chair and  looked as  if  he  were  reliving  his  first  encounter with the One Minute Manager “So” the young man began reflecting on what he had just heard  18 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER One Minute Goals Summary One Minute Goal Setting is simply 1  Agree on your goals 2  See what good behavior looks like 3  Write out each of your goals on a single sheet of paper using less than 250 words 4  Read   and   reread   each   goal   which requires only a minute or so each time you do it 5  Take a minute every once in a while out of your day to look at your performance and 6  See whether or not your behavior matches your goal 19 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “That’s it” Trenell exclaimed “you’re a fast learner” “Thank you” the young man said feeling good about himself “But let me just jot that down” he said “I want to remember that” After the young man wrote briefly in the small blue notebook he carried with him he leaned  forward and asked  “If One  Minute Goal  Setting  is the  first secret to becoming a One Minute Manager what are the other two” Trenell smiled looked at his watch and said “Why don’t you ask Levy that You are scheduled to see him this morning too aren’t you” The young man was amazed How did Trenell know that “Yes” the young man said as he rose to shake Trenell’s hand “Thanks so much for your time sir” “You’re welcome” Trenell answered “Time is one thing I have a lot more of now As you can probably tell I’m becoming a One Minute Manager myself” 20 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The Second Secret One Minute Praisings As  the  young  man  left  Trenell’s  office  he  was  struck by the  simplicity  of  what  he  had heard  He  thought  “It  certainly  makes  sense  After  all  how  can  you  be  an  effective manager  unless  you  and  your  people  are  sure  of  what  they  are  being  asked  to  do  And what an efficient way to do it” The young man walked the length of the building and took the elevator to the second floor When he got to Mr Levy’s office he was surprised to meet so young a man Levy was probably in his late 20’s or early 30’s “Well you’ve been to see the ‘ole man’ He’s quite a guy isn’t he” He was already getting used to the One Minute Manager being called “quite a guy” “I guess he is” responded the young man “Did he tell you about being a One Minute Manager” asked Levy “He  sure  did  It’s  not  true  is  it”  asked  the  young  man  wondering  if  he’d  get  a different answer from Trenell’s “You’d better believe it’s true I hardly ever see him” “You mean you never get any help from him” pursued the young man “Essentially  very  little  although  he  does spend  a  fair  amount  of time  with  me  at  the beginning of a new task or responsibility” “Yes I know about One Minute Goal Setting” interrupted the young man “Actually I wasn’t thinking so much about One Minute Goal Setting I was referring to One Minute Praisings” “One  Minute  Praisings”  echoed  the  young  man  “Are  they  the  second  secret  to becoming a One Minute Manager” “Yes  they  are”  Levy  revealed  “In  fact  when  I  first  started  to  work  here  the  One Minute Manager made it very clear to me what he was going to do” “What was that” the visitor asked “He  said that he knew that  it would be a  lot easier for me to do well if I got crystalclear feedback from him on how I was doing “He said he wanted me to succeed He wanted me to be a big help to the organization and to enjoy my work “He told me that he would try therefore to let me know  in no uncertain terms  when I was doing well and when I was doing poorly “And then  he cautioned  me that it might not be very comfortable at first  for either of us” “Why” the visitor asked “Because  as  he  pointed  out  to  me  then  most  managers  don’t  manage  that  way  and people  aren’t  used  to  it  Then  he  assured  me that  such  feedback  would  be a  big  help  to me” “Can  you  give  me  an  example  of  what  you  are  talking  about”  the  young  man requested “Sure”  Levy  complied  “Shortly  after  I  started  to  work  I  noticed  that  after  my manager had done One Minute Goal Setting with me he would stay in close contact” “What do you mean by ‘close contact’” asked the young man 21 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “There  were  two  ways  that  he did  it”  explained  Levy  “First of  all  he  observed  my activities very closely He never seemed to be very far away Secondly he made me keep detailed records of my progress which he insisted I send to him” “That’s interesting” said the young man “Why does he do that” “At  first  I thought  he  was  spying  and  didn’t trust me  That  is until  I found out  from some of the other people who report to him what he was really doing” “What was that” the young man wanted to know “He was trying to catch me doing something right” Levy said “Catch you doing something right” echoed the young man “Yes” responded Levy “We have a motto around here that says 22 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER ê Help People Reach Their Full Potential Catch Them Doing Something Right ê 23 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER Levy  continued  “In  most  organizations  the  managers  spend  most  of  their  time catching people doing what” he asked the young man The young man smiled and said knowingly “Doing something wrong” “Right”  said  Levy  “Here  we  put  the  accent on  the  positive  We  catch  people  doing something  right” The young man made a few notes in his notebook and then asked “What happens Mr Levy when the One Minute Manager catches you doing something right” “That’s when he gives you a One Minute Praising” Levy said with some delight “What does that mean” the young man wanted to know “Well  when  he  has  seen  that  you  have  done  something  right  he  comes  over  and makes contact with you That often includes putting his hand on your shoulder or briefly touching you in a friendly way” “Doesn’t that bother you” the young man wondered “when he touches you” “No”  Levy  insisted “On the contrary it helps I  know he really cares about me and he wants me to prosper As he says The more consistently successful your people are the higher you rise in the organization’ “When he makes contact it’s brief but it lets me know once again that we’re really on the same side “Anyway after that” Levy continued “he  looks you straight in the eye and tells  you precisely what you did right Then he shares with you how good he feels about what you did” “I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a manager doing that” the young man broke in “That must make you feel pretty good” “It certainly does” Levy confirmed “for several  reasons First of all I get a praising as soon as I’ve done something right” He smiled and leaned towards his visitor Then he laughed  and  said  “I  don’t  have  to  wait  for  an  annual  performance review  if  you  know what I mean” Both men smiled “Second since  he  specifies exactly what I did right I know he’s sincere and  familiar with what I am doing Third he is consistent” “Consistent” echoed the young man wanting to know more “Yes” insisted Levy “He will praise me if I am performing well and deserve it even if things  are  not  going  well  for  him  elsewhere  I  know  he  may  be  annoyed  about  other things  But  he  responds  to  where  I  am not  just to where he  is at  the  time  And  I  really appreciate that” “Doesn’t all this praising have to take up a lot of the manager’s time” the young man asked “Not really” said Levy  “Remember  you don’t have to praise someone for very  long for them to know you noticed and you care It usually takes less than a minute” “And that’s why it’s called a One Minute Praising” the visitor said as he wrote down what he was learning “Right” Levy said “Is he always trying to catch you doing something right” the young man asked “No of course not” Levy answered “Just when you first start work here or when you begin a new project or responsibility then he does After you get to know the ropes he doesn’t seem to be around much” “Why” the young man wondered 24 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “Because  you  and  he  have  other  ways  of  knowing  when  your  job  performance  is ‘praiseworthy’  You  both  can  review  the  data  in  the  information  systemthe  sales figures  expenditures  production  schedules  and  so  on  And  then”  Levy  added  “after awhile  you  begin  to  catch  yourself  doing  things  right  and  you  start  praising  yourself Also  you’re  always  wondering  when he  might praise  you  again  and  that  seems  to  keep you going even when he’s not around It’s uncanny I’ve never worked so hard at a job in my life” “That’s really  interesting” commented the  young man “So One  Minute Praising  is a secret to becoming a One Minute Manager” “It is indeed” Levy said with a gleam in his eye He enjoyed watching someone learn the secrets of One Minute Management As the visitor looked at his notes he quickly reviewed what he had learned about the One Minute Praising 25 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER One Minute Praisings Summary The One Minute Praising works well when you 1  Tell people up front that you are going to let them know how they are doing 2  Praise people immediately 3  Tell   people   what  they   did   rightbe specific 4  Tell people how good you feel about what they did right  and how it helps the organization and the other people who work there 5  Stop for a moment of silence to let them “feel” how good you feel 6  Encourage them to do more of the same 7  Shake hands or touch people in a way that makes it clear that you support their success in the organization 26 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “What’s the third secret” the young man asked anxiously Levy laughed at the visitor’s enthusiasm rose from his chair and said “Why don’t you ask Ms Brown I understand you’re planning to talk to her too” “Yes I am” admitted the young man “Well thanks so much for your time” “That’s OK”  insisted Levy  “Time  is one thing I have plenty ofyou see I’m a One Minute Manager myself now” The visitor smiled He’d heard that somewhere before He  wanted  to  reflect  on  what  he  was  learning  He  left  the  building  and  took  a  walk among the trees nearby He was struck again by the simplicity and common sense of what he  had  heard  “How  can  you  argue  with  the  effectiveness  of  catching  people  doing something right” the young man thought “especially after they know what they are to do and what good performance looks like “But do One Minute Praisings really work” he wondered “Does all this One Minute Management stuff really get resultsbottomline results” As  he  walked  along  his  curiosity  about  results  increased  So  he  returned  to  the  One Minute Manager’s secretary and asked Ms Metcalfe to reschedule  his appointment with Ms Brown for some time the next morning “Tomorrow morning is fine” the secretary said as she hung up the phone “Ms Brown said to tell you to come any time except Wednesday morning” Then she called downtown and made the new appointment he requested He was to see Ms Gomez an official in the headquarters office “They have information there about all the  different  plants  and  locations  in  the  total  company”  Ms  Metcalfe  said  in  a  very knowing  way  “I’m  sure  you’ll  find  whatever  you’re  looking  for”  He  thanked  her  and left 27 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The Appraisal AFTER  lunch  the  young  man  went  downtown  He  met  with  Ms  Gomez  a  competent looking  woman  in  her  early  40’s  Getting  down  to  business  the  young  man  asked “Could  you please tell  me what  is the most efficient and effective of all  your operations in the country I want to compare it with the socalled ‘One Minute Manager’s’ ” A  moment  later  he  laughed  as  he  heard  Ms  Gomez  say  “Well  you  won’t  have  to look  very  far  because  it  is  the  One  Minute  Manager’s  He’s  quite  a  guy  isn’t  he  His operation is the most efficient and effective of all of our plants” “That’s unbelievable” said the young man “Does he have the best equipment’’ “No” said Ms Gomez “In fact he’s got some of the oldest” “Well there’s got to be something wrong out there” said the young man still puzzled by the old  man’s  management style “Tell  me does he  lose a  lot of his people Does he have a lot of turnover” “Come to think of it” Ms Gomez said “he does have a lot of turnover” “Aha” the young man said thinking he was on to something “What happens to those folks when they leave the One Minute Manager” the  young man wanted to know “We give them their own operation” Ms Gomez quickly responded “After two years with  him they  say  ‘Who needs  a manager’  He’s our best trainer of people  Whenever we  have  an  opening  and  need  a  good  manager  we  call  him  He  always  has  somebody who is ready” Amazed  the  young  man  thanked  Ms  Gomez  for  her  timebut  this  time  he  got  a different response “I was glad I could fit you in today” she said “The rest of my week is really jammed I  wish  I  knew  what  the  One  Minute  Manager’s  secrets  were  I’ve  been  meaning  to  go over there and see him but I just haven’t had time” Smiling the young man said “I’ll give you those secrets as a gift when I find them out myself Just like he’s giving them to me” “That would be a precious present” Ms Gomez said with a smile She looked around her cluttered office and said “I could use whatever help I can get” The  young  man  left  Ms  Gomez’s  office  and  walked  out  onto  the  street  shaking  his head The One Minute Manager was absolutely fascinating to him That  night  the  young  man  had  a  very  restless  sleep  He  found  himself  excited  about the next dayabout learning the third secret to becoming a One Minute Manager 28 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The Third Secret One Minute Reprimands THE next morning he arrived at Ms Brown’s office at the stroke of nine A very smartly dressed  woman  in  her  late  50’s  greeted  him  He  got  the  usual  “He’s  quite  a  guy  isn’t he” routine but by now the young man was getting to the point where he could sincerely say “Yes he is” “Did he tell you about being a One Minute Manager” asked Ms Brown “That’s  all  I’ve  been  hearing  about” the  young  man  said  laughing  “It’s  not true  is it” he asked still wondering if he’d get a different answer “You’d better believe it is I hardly ever see him” “You mean you don’t have much contact with him” pursued the young man “outside your regular weekly meeting” “Essentially  very  little  Except  of  course  when  I  do  something  wrong”  said  Ms Brown Shocked  the  young  man  said  “You  mean  the  only  time  you  see  the  One  Minute Manager is when you do something wrong” “Yes Well not quite” said Ms Brown “but almost” “But I thought a key motto around here was catching people doing things right” “It is” insisted Brown “But you have to know some things about me” “What” asked the young man “I’ve been working here for quite a few years I know this operation inside and out As a result the One Minute Manager doesn’t have to spend  much time with  me  if  any on goal setting In fact I usually write out my goals and send them over to him” “Is each goal on a separate sheet of paper” asked the young man “You  bet  No  longer  than  250  words  and  each  one  takes  me  or  the  One  Minute Manager only a minute to read “Another thing about me that’s important is that I just love my work As a result I do most of  my own One Minute Praisings In fact I believe  if  you’re  not for yourself who is A friend of mine told me a motto I’ll always remember ‘If you don’t blow your own horn someone else will use it as a spittoon’ ” The young man smiled He liked her sense of humor “Does your manager ever praise you” he asked “Sometimes he does but he doesn’t have to do it very often because I beat him to the punch” answered Ms Brown “When I do something especially good I might even ask the One Minute Manager for a praising” “How would you ever have the nerve to do that” asked the young man “It’s easy Just like making a bet where I either win or I break even If he gives me the praising I win” “But if he doesn’t” the young man broke in “Then I break even” responded Ms Brown “I didn’t have it before I asked” The  young  man  smiled  as  he  took  note  of  Ms  Brown’s  philosophy  and  then continued “You  said  he  spends  time  with  you  when  you  do  something  wrong  What  do  you mean” asked the young man 29 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “If  I  make  a  significant  mistake  that’s  when  I  invariably  get  a  One  Minute Reprimand” Ms Brown said “A what” the startled young man asked “A  One  Minute  Reprimand”  Ms  Brown  repeated  “That’s  the  third  secret  to becoming a One Minute Manager” “How does it work” wondered the young man out loud “It’s simple” said Ms Brown “I figured you’d say that” said the young man Ms  Brown  joined  his  laugh  and  explained  “If  you  have  been  doing  a  job  for  some time and you know how to do it well and you make a mistake the One Minute Manager is quick to respond” “What does he do” asked the young man “As soon  as  he  has  learned  about the  mistake he  comes to see  me  First  he  confirms the facts Then he might put his hand on my shoulder or maybe just come around to my side of the desk” “Doesn’t that bother you” asked the young man “Sure  it  does  because  you  know  what’s  coming  especially  since  he  doesn’t  have  a smile on his face “He  looks  me  straight  in  the  eye”  she  continued  “and  tells  me  precisely  what  I  did wrong Then he shares with me how he feels about ithe’s angry annoyed frustrated or whatever he is feeling” “How long does that take” asked the young man “Only about 30 seconds but sometimes it seems forever to me” confided Ms Brown The  visitor  couldn’t  help  but  remember  the  feelings  he  had  when  the  One  Minute Manager told him “in no uncertain terms” how annoyed he was with his indecision “And then what happens” the young man asked as he moved to the edge of his chair “He lets what he said sink in with a few seconds of silenceboy does it sink in” “Then what” the young man asked “He looks me squarely in the eye and lets me know how competent he thinks I usually am He makes sure I understand that the only reason he is angry with me is that he has so much respect for me He says he knows this is so unlike me He says how much he looks forward to seeing me some other time as long as I understand that he does not welcome that same mistake again” The young man broke in “It must make you think twice” “It certainly does” Ms Brown nodded vigorously The young man knew what Ms Brown was talking about He was taking notes now as fast as he could He sensed that it wasn’t going to take this woman long to cover several important points “First  of  all”  Ms  Brown  said  “he  usually  gives  me  the  reprimand  as  soon  as  I’ve done something wrong Second since he specifies exactly what I did wrong I know he is ‘on  top  of  things’  and  that  I’m  not  going  to  get  away  with  sloppiness  Third  since  he doesn’t  attack  me  as  a  persononly  my  behaviorit’s  easier  for  me  not  to  become defensive  I  don’t  try  to  rationalize  away  my  mistake  by  fixing  blame  on  him  or somebody else I know he is being fair And fourth he is consistent” “Does that mean he will reprimand you for doing something wrong even if things are going well for him elsewhere” 30 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “Yes” she answered “Does the whole process really take only a minute” the young man asked “Usually” she said “And when it’s over it’s over A One Minute Reprimand doesn’t last  long  but  I  can  guarantee  you  you  don’t  forget  itand  you  don’t  usually  make  the same mistake twice” “I think  I  know  what  you’re  talking  about” the  young  man  said  “I’m  afraid I  asked him ” “I hope” she interrupted “you didn’t ask him to repeat himself” The young man was embarrassed “I did” he confessed “Then  you  know  what  it’s  like  to  be  on  the  receiving  end  of  a  One  Minute Reprimand” she said “Although I expect as a visitor you got a rather mild one” “I don’t know  if  you’d call  it  mild” he said “but I don’t think I’ll ask  him to repeat himself very often That was a mistake “I  wonder”  the  visitor  said  out  loud  “if  the  One  Minute  Manager  ever  makes  a mistake He seems almost too perfect” Ms  Brown  began  to  laugh  “Hardly”  she  said  “But  he  does  have  a  good  sense  of humor  So  when  he  does  make  a  mistake  like  forgetting  to  do  the  last  half  of  the  One Minute Reprimand we point it out to him and kid him about it “After we’ve had time to recover from the Reprimand that is We might for example phone him later and tell him we know we were wrong Then we might laugh and ask for the praising half of the Reprimand because we’re not feeling too good” “And what does he do then” the young man asked “He  usually  laughs  and  says  he’s  sorry  he  forgot  to  remind  me  that  I  am  an  OK Person” “You can laugh about praisings and reprimands” the young man asked “Sure” Ms Brown said “You see the One Minute Manager has taught us the value of being  able  to  laugh  at  ourselves  when  we  make  a  mistake  It  helps  us  get  on  with  our work” “That’s terrific” the young man enthused “How did you learn to do that” “Simply” Ms Brown answered “by watching the boss do it himself” “You mean your boss can laugh at himself when he makes a mistake” the astonished young man asked “Well not always” Ms Brown admitted “He’s like most of us Sometimes it’s tough But he often can And when he does laugh at himself it has a positive effect on everyone around him” “He must be pretty secure” the young man suggested “He is” Ms Brown answered The young man was impressed He was beginning to see how valuable such a manager was to an organization “Why do you think the One Minute Manager’s reprimands are so effective” he asked “I’ll let you ask the One Minute Manager” she said as she rose from behind the desk and walked the young man to the door When  he thanked  her  for her time Ms Brown smiled and said  “You know what the response  to  that  is  going  to  be”  They  both  laughed  He  was  beginning  to  feel  like  an “insider” rather than a visitor and that felt good 31 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER As soon as he was in the hall he realized how little time he’d spent with her and how much information she had given him He reflected on what she had said It sounded so simple He reviewed in his own mind what you should do when you catch an experienced person doing something wrong 32 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER One Minute Reprimands Summary The One Minute Reprimand works well when you 1 Tell people beforehand that you are going to let them know how they are doing and in no uncertain terms the first half of the reprimand 2 Reprimand people immediately 3 Tell people what they did wrongbe specific 4 Tell people how you feel about what they did wrongand in no uncertain terms 5 Stop for a few seconds of uncomfortable silence to let them feel how you feel the second half of the reprimand 6 Shake hands or touch them in a way that lets them know you are honestly on their side 7 Remind them how much you value them 8 Reaffirm that you think well of them but not of their performance in this situation 9 Realize that when the reprimand is over it’s over 33 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The  young  man  may  not  have  believed  in  the  effectiveness  of  the  One  Minute Reprimand if he hadn’t personally experienced its effect There was no doubt that he felt uncomfortable And he did not want to experience it again However he knew that everyone made mistakes now and then and that he might very well receive another reprimand  some day  But he knew  if it came  from the One Minute Manager that it would be fair that it would be a comment on his behavior and not on his worth as a person As  he  headed  toward  the  One  Minute  Manager’s  office  he  kept  thinking  about  the simplicity of One Minute Management All  three  of  the  secrets  made  senseOne  Minute  Goals  One  Minute  Praisings  and One  Minute  Reprimands  “But  why  do  they  work”  he  wondered  “Why  is  the  One Minute Manager the most productive manager in the company” 34 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The One Minute Manager Explains WHEN  he  got  to  the  One  Minute  Manager’s  his  secretary  said  “You  can  go  right  in He’s been wondering when you’d be back to see him” As  the  young  man  entered  the  office  he  noticed  again  how  clear  and  uncluttered  it was He was greeted by a warm smile from the One Minute Manager “Well what did you find out in your travels” he asked “A lot” the young man said enthusiastically “Tell me what you learned” the manager encouraged “I found out why you call yourself a One Minute Manager You set One Minute Goals with  your  people  to  make  sure  they know  what they  are  being  held  accountable  for and what good performance  looks  like You then try to catch them doing something right so you can give them a One Minute Praising And then finally if they have all the skills to do something right and they don’t you give them a One Minute Reprimand” “What do you think about all that” asked the One Minute Manager “I’m  amazed  at  how  simple  it  is”  said  the  young  man  “and  yet  it  worksyou  get results I’m convinced that it certainly works for you” “And it will for you too if you’re willing to do it” the manager insisted “Perhaps”  said  the  young  man  “but  I  would  be  more  likely  to  do  it  if  I  could understand more about  why it works” “That’s  true  of  everyone  young  man  The  more  you  understand  why  it  works  the more apt you are to  use it I’d be happy therefore to tell you what I know Where do you want to start” “Well first of all when you talk about One Minute Management do you really mean it takes a minute to do all the kinds of things you need to do as a manager” “No not always It just is a way to say that being a manager is not as complicated as people would have you believe And also managing people doesn’t take as long as you’d think So when I say One Minute Management it might take more than a minute for each of the key elements like goal setting but it’s just a symbolic term And very often it does take only a minute “Let me show you one of the notes I keep on my desk” When he looked the young man saw 35 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER ê The Best Minute I Spend Is The One I Invest In People ê 36 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “It’s ironic” the manager said “Most companies spend 50 to 70 of their money on people’s  salaries  And  yet they  spend  less than 1  of their  budget to train  their  people Most companies in fact spend more time and money on maintaining their buildings and equipment than they do on maintaining and developing people” “I  never  thought of  that” the  young  man  admitted “But if people get  results  then  it certainly makes good sense to invest in people” “Exactly”  the  manager  said  “I wish  I had  had  someone  invest  in  me  sooner when  I first went to work” “What do you mean” the young man asked “Well in most of the organizations I worked in before I often didn’t know what I was supposed to be doing No one bothered to tell me If you asked me whether I was doing a good job I would say either ‘I don’t know’ or ‘I think so’ If you asked why I thought so I would reply ‘I haven’t been chewed out by my boss lately’ or ‘no news is good news’ It was almost as if my main motivation was to avoid punishment” “That’s interesting” the young man admitted “But I’m not sure I understand it” Then he added anxiously “In fact if it’s all right with you maybe I could understand things  better  if  I  could  get  to  some  of  my  ‘why’  questions  Let’s  start  with One  Minute Goal Setting Why does it work so well” 37 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER Why One Minute Goals Work “YOU want to know why One Minute Goals work” the manager said “Fine” He got up and began to pace slowly around the room “Let me give you an analogy that might help I’ve seen a lot of unmotivated people at work  in  the  various  organizations  I’ve  been  employed  in  over the  years But  I’ve  never seen an unmotivated person after work Everyone seems to be motivated to do something “One night for example I was bowling and I saw some of the ‘problem employees’ at work from  my  last organization One of the real  problem people who I remembered  all too  well  took  the  bowling  ball  and  approached  the  line  and  rolled  the  ball  Then  he started to scream and yell and jump around Why do you think he was so happy” “Because he got a strike He had knocked down all the pins” “Exactly Why don’t you think he and other people are that excited at work” “Because he doesn’t know where the pins are” smiled the young man “I get it How long would he want to bowl if there were no pins” “Right”  said  the  One  Minute  Manager  “Now  you  can  see  what  happens  in  most organizations  I  believe  that  most  managers  know  what  they  want  their  people  to  do They just don’t bother to tell their people in a way they would understand They assume they should know I never assume anything when it comes to goal setting “When  you  assume  that  people  know  what’s  expected  of  them  you  are  creating  an ineffective  form  of  bowling  You  put  the  pins  up  but  when  the  bowler  goes  to  roll  the ball  he  notices  there  is  a  sheet  across  the  pins  So  when  he  rolls  the  ball  and  it  slips under  the  sheet  he  hears  a  crack  but  doesn’t  know  how  many  pins  he  knocked  down When you ask him how he did he says  I don’t know But it felt good “It’s  like  playing  golf  at  night  A  lot  of  my  friends  have  given  up  golf  and  when  I asked them why they said ‘Because the courses are too crowded’ When I suggested that they play at night they laughed because who would ever play golf without being able to see the pins “It’s the same with watching  football How many people  in this country  would sit  in front of their TV’s on a Sunday afternoon or Monday night and watch two teams run up and down the field if there were no goals to shoot at or any way to score” “Yeah Why is that” asked the young man “It’s all because clearly the number one motivator of people is feedback on results In fact  we  have  another  saying  here  that’s  worth  noting  ‘ Feedback  is  the  Breakfast  of Champions’  Feedback  keeps  us  going  Unfortunately  however  when  most  managers realize that feedback on results is the number one motivator of people they usually set up a third form of bowling “When the bowler goes to the line to roll the ball the pins are still up and the sheet is in  place  but  now  there  is  another  ingredient  in the  gamea  supervisor  standing  behind the sheet  When  the  bowler  rolls  the  ball  he  hears  the  crash  of the  falling pins  and  the supervisor holds up two fingers to signify you knocked down two pins Actually do most managers say you got two” “No” the young man smiled “They usually say you missed eight” 38 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “Right  on”  said  the  One  Minute  Manager  “The  question  I  always  used  to  ask  was why  doesn’t  the  manager  ‘lift  the  sheet  up’  so  both  he  and  his  subordinate  can  see  the pins Why Because he has the great American traditionPerformance Reviewcoming up” “Because he has Performance Review coming up” wondered the young man “Right I used to call that ‘NIHYSOB’ which stands for ‘Now I have youyou SOB’ Such  managers  don’t  tell  their  people  what  they  expect  of  them  they  just  leave  them alone and then ‘zap’ them when they don’t perform at the desired level” “Why  do  you  suppose  they  would  do  that”  the  young  man  inquired  being  very familiar with the truth in the manager’s comments “So they can look good” said the manager “What do you mean so they can look good” asked the young man “How  do  you  think  you  would  be  viewed  by  your  boss  if  you  rated  everyone  that reported to you at the highest level on your performance review scale” “As a ‘soft touch’ as someone who could not discriminate between good performance and poor performance” “Precisely”  said  the  manager  “In  order  to  look  good  as  a  manager  in  most organizations  you  have  to  catch  some of  your  people  doing things  wrong  You  have  to have a  few winners a  few  losers and everyone else somewhere  in the middle You see in this country we have a normaldistributioncurve mentality I remember one time when visiting my son’s school I observed a fifthgrade teacher giving a state capitals test to her class When I asked  her why  she didn’t put atlases around the room and  let the kids use them  during  the  test  she  said  ‘I  couldn’t  do  that  because  all  the  kids  would  get  100 percent’ As though it would be bad for everyone to do well “I remember once reading that when someone asked Einstein what his phone number was he went to the phone book to look it up” The young man laughed “You’re kidding” “No I’m  not kidding He  said  he  never cluttered his mind with  information  he could find somewhere else “Now  if  you  didn’t  know  better” the  manager  continued  “what  would  you  think  of someone who went to the phone  book to look up his own  number  Would  you think  he was a winner or a loser” The young man grinned and said “A real loser” “Sure” the manager responded “I would too but we’d be wrong wouldn’t we” The young man nodded his agreement “It’s easy  for any of us to make this mistake” the manager said Then  he showed his visitor the plaque he had made for himself “Look at this” 39 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER ê Everyone Is A Potential Winner Some People Are Disguised As Losers Don’t Let Their Appearances Fool You ê 40 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “You see” the  manager said  “you really  have three choices as a  manager First  you can hire winners They are hard to find and they cost money Or second if you can’t find a  winner  you  can  hire  someone  with  the  potential  to  be  a  winner  Then  you systematically train that person to become a winner If you are not willing to do either of the first two and I am continually amazed at the number of managers who won’t spend the money to hire a winner or take the time to train someone to become a winner then there is only the third choice leftprayer” That  stopped  the  young  man  cold  He  put  down  his  notebook  and  pen  and  said “Prayer” The  manager  laughed  quietly  “That’s  just  my  attempt  at  humor  young  man  But when you think about it there are many managers who are saying their prayers daily‘I hope this person works out’ ” “Oh”  the  young  man  said  seriously  “Well  let’s  take  the  first  choice  If  you  hire  a winner it’s really easy to be a One Minute Manager isn’t it” “It sure is” said the  manager with a smile He was amazed at how serious the  young man was  nowas though being  more serious made a person a better manager “All you have to do with a winner is do One Minute Goal Setting and let them run with the ball” “I understand  from Ms Brown sometimes  you don’t even  have to do that with  her” said the young man “She’s  absolutely  right”  said  the  manager  “She’s  forgotten  more  than  most  people know  around  here  But  with  everyone  winner  or  potential  winner  One  Minute  Goal Setting is a basic tool for productive behavior” “Is  it true that no matter who  initiates the One  Minute Goal Setting” the  young  man asked “each goal always has to be written down on a single sheet of paper” “Absolutely” insisted the One Minute Manager “Why is that so important” “So people can review their goals frequently and then check their performance against those goals” “I  understand  you  have  them  write  down  only  their  major  goals  and  responsibilities and not every aspect of their job” the young man said “Yes That’s because I don’t want this to be a paper mill I don’t want a lot of pieces of  paper  filed  away  somewhere  and  looked  at only  once  a  year  when  it’s  time  for  next year’s goal setting or performance review or some such thing “As you probably saw everyone who works for me has a plaque near them that looks like this” He showed his visitor his copy of the plaque 41 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER ê Take A Minute Look At Your Goals Look At Your Performance See If Your Behavior Matches Your Goals ê 42 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER The young man was amazed He’d missed this in his brief visit “I never saw this” he said “It’s terrific Could I get one of these plaques” “Sure” the manager said “I’ll arrange it” As  he  was  writing  down  some  of  what  he  was  learning  the  aspiring  manager  said without lifting up his head “You know it’s difficult to learn everything there is to learn about  One  Minute  Management  in  such a  short time  There’s  certainly  more  I’d  like  to learn about One Minute Goals for instance but maybe I could do that later “Could we  move to One Minute Praisings now”  asked the  young  man as he  looked up from his notebook “Sure” said the  One  Minute Manager  “You’re probably wondering why that works too” “I certainly am” the visitor responded 43 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER Why One Minute Praisings Work LET’S  look  at  a  few  examples”  the  One Minute  Manager  said  “Maybe  then  it  will  be clear to you why One Minute Praisings work so well” “I’d like that” said the young man “I’ll start with a pigeon example and then move on to people” said the manager “Just remember  young  man  people  are  not  pigeons  People  are  more  complicated  They  are aware  they  think  for  themselves  and  they  certainly  don’t  want  to  be  manipulated  by another person Remember that and respect that It is a key to good management “With that in  mind  let us look at several simple  examples which show us that we all seek what feels good to us and we avoid what feels bad to us “Suppose you have an untrained pigeon that you want to enter a box in the lower lefthand corner and run across the box to the upper righthand corner and push a lever with his right  foot Suppose that not too far from the entry point we  have a pellet  machine that  is  a  machine  that  can  release  pellets  of  food  to  reward  and  reinforce  the  pigeon What do you think  is going to happen  if we put the pigeon  in the  box and wait until the pigeon runs  over to the  upper righthand  corner  and  pushes  the  lever  with  his right  foot before we give him any food” asked the One Minute Manager “He would starve to death” responded the young man “You’re  right  We’re  going  to lose a  lot of pigeons  The  pigeon  is  going to starve to death because he doesn’t have any idea what he is supposed to do “Now it’s actually not too hard to train a pigeon to do this task All you have to do is to draw a line  not too far  from where the pigeon  enters the box If the pigeon enters the box  and  crosses  the  linebangthe  pellet  machine  goes  off  and  the  pigeon  gets  fed Pretty soon you have the pigeon running to that spot but you don’t want the pigeon there Where do you want the pigeon” “In the upper righthand corner of the box” said the young man “Right”  the  One  Minute  Manager  confirmed  “Therefore  after  a  while  you  stop rewarding  the  pigeon  for  running  to that  spot  and draw another  line which  isn’t too far from the  last  line but  is  in the direction of the goalthe upper righthand  corner of the box Now the pigeon  starts running around  his old spot and doesn’t get fed Pretty  soon though the pigeon makes it across the new line andbangthe machine goes off again and the pigeon gets fed “Then you draw another line Again this line has to be in the direction of the goal but not too far away that the pigeon can’t make it again We keep setting up these lines closer and closer to the upper righthand corner of the box until we won’t feed the pigeon unless he hits the lever and then finally only when he hits the lever with his right foot” “Why do you set up all these little goals” wondered the young man “By  setting  up  these  series  of  lines  we  are  establishing  goals  that  the  pigeon  can achieve  So  the  key  to  training  someone  to  do  a  new  task  is  in  the  beginning  to  catch them doing something approximately right until they can eventually learn to do it exactly right “We  use  this  concept  all  the  time  with  kids  and  animals  but  we  somehow  forget  it when  we  are  dealing  with  big  peopleadults  For  example  at  some  of  these  Sea 44 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER Aquariums  you  see  ‘round  the  country  they  usually  end  the  show  by  having  a  huge whale jump over a rope which is high above the water When the whale comes down he drenches the first ten rows “The  people  leave  that  show  mumbling  to  themselves  That’s  unbelievable  How  do they teach that whale to do that’ “Do you think they go out in the ocean in a boat” the manager asked “and put a rope out over the water and yell ‘Up up’ until a whale jumps out of the water over the rope And then say ‘Hey let’s hire him He’s a real winner’ ” “No” laughed the young man “but that really  would be hiring a winner” The two men enjoyed the laugh they shared “You’re  right”  the  manager  said  “When  they  captured  the  whale  he  knew  nothing about jumping  over  ropes  So  when  they  began  to train  him  in  the  large  pool  where  do you think they started the rope” “At the bottom of the pool” answered the young man “Of  course”  responded  the  manager  “Every  time  the  whale  swam  over  the  rope which was every time he swam pasthe got fed Soon they raised the rope a little “If  the  whale  swam  under  the  rope  he  didn’t  get  fed  during  training  Whenever  he swam  over  the  rope  he  got  fed  So  after  a  while  the  whale  started  swimming  over  the rope all of the time Then they started raising the rope a little higher” “Why do they raise the rope” asked the young man “First”  the  manager  began  “because they  were  clear  on  the  goal  to  have  the  whale jump high out of the water and over the rope “And second” the One Minute Manager pointed out “it’s not a very exciting show for a trainer to say  ‘Folks the whale did it again’ Everybody  may  be looking in the water but they can’t see anything Over a period of time they keep on raising the rope until they finally get  it to the surface of the water Now the great whale knows that in order to get fed he  has  to  jump  partially  out of the water  and  over the  rope As soon  as  that goal  is reached they can start raising the rope higher and higher out of the water” “So  that’s  how  they  do  it”  the  young  man  said  “Well  I  can  understand  now  how using that method works with animals but isn’t it a bit much to use it with people” “No it’s very natural in fact” the manager said “We all do essentially the same thing with  the  children  we  care  for  How  do  you  think  you  teach  them  to  walk  Can  you imagine standing a child up and saying ‘Walk’ and when he falls down you pick him up and spank him and say ‘I told you to walk’ No you stand the child up and the first day he wobbles a little bit and you get all excited and say ‘He stood he stood’ and you hug and kiss the child The  next day  he stands for a moment and maybe wobbles a  step and you are all over him with kisses and hugs “Finally  the  child  realizing  that  this  is  a  pretty  good  deal  starts  to  wobble  his  legs more and more until he eventually walks “The  same  thing  goes  for  teaching  a  child  to  speak  Suppose  you  wanted  a  child  to say  ‘Give  me  a  glass  of  water  please’  If  you  waited  until  the  child  said  the  whole sentence before you gave her any water the child would die of thirst So you start off by saying  ‘Water  water’  All  of  a  sudden  one  day  the  child  says  ‘Waller’  You  jump  all over the place hug and kiss the child get grandmother on the phone so the child can say ‘Waller waller’ That wasn’t ‘water’ but it was close 45 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “Now you don’t want a kid going into a restaurant at the age of twentyone asking for a glass of ‘waller’ so after a while you only accept the word ‘water’ and then  you begin on ‘please’ “These  examples  illustrate  that  the  most  important  thing  in  training  somebody  to become a winner is to catch them doing something rightin the beginning approximately right and gradually moving them towards the desired behavior With a winner you don’t have  to  catch  them  doing  things  right  very  often  because  good  performers  catch themselves doing things right and are able to be selfreinforcing” “Is that why you observe new people a lot in the beginning” asked the young man “or when your more experienced people are starting a new project” “Yes”  the  One  Minute  Manager  said  “Most  managers  wait  until  their  people  do something  exactly  right  before  they  praise  them  As  a  result  many  people  never  get  to become  high  performers  because  their  managers  concentrate  on  catching  them  doing things  wrongthat  is  anything  that  falls  short of  the  final  desired  performance  In  our pigeon example it would be like putting the pigeon in the box and not only waiting until he hits the  lever to give  him  any  food but putting some electric grills around the  box to punish him periodically just to keep him motivated” “That doesn’t sound like it would be very effective” the young man suggested “Well  it  isn’t” agreed the One Minute Manager “After getting punished for a while and not knowing what acceptable behavior is that is hitting the lever the pigeon would go into the corner of the box and not move To the pigeon it is a hostile environment and not worth taking any risks in “That is what we often do with new inexperienced people We welcome them aboard take them around to meet everybody and then we leave them alone Not only do we not catch them doing anything approximately right but periodically we zap them just to keep them moving This is the most popular leadership style of all We call it the ‘leave alonezap’ style You leave a person alone expecting good performance from them and when you don’t get it you zap them” “What happens to these people” asked the young man “If  you’ve  been  in  any  organization  and  I  understand  you’ve  visited  several”  the manager said “you know because you’ve seen them They do as little as possible “And  that’s  what’s  wrong  with  most  businesses  today  Their  people  really  do  not produceeither quantity or quality “And  much  of  the  reason  for  this  poor  business  performance  is  simply  because  the people are managed so poorly” The young man put his notebook down He thought about what he just heard He was beginning to see One Minute Management for what it isa practical business tool It  was  amazing  to  him  how  well  something  as  simple  as  the  One  Minute  Praising workedwhether it was inside or outside the business world “That reminds me of some friends of mine” the young man said “They called me and said that they’d gotten a new dog They asked me what I thought of their planned method of training the dog” The manager was almost afraid to ask “How were they going to do it” “They  said  if  the  dog  had  an  accident  on  the  rug  they  were  going  to  take  the  dog shove his nose in it pound him on the butt with a newspaper and then throw the dog out 46 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER this little  window  in the kitchen  into the back yardwhere the dog was  supposed to do his job “Then  they  asked  me  what  I  thought  would  happen  with  this  method  I  laughed because  I  knew  what  would  happen  After about three  days the dog would  poop  on  the floor  and  jump  out  the  window  The  dog  didn’t  know  what  to  do  but  he  knew  he  had better clear the area” The manager roared his approval “That’s a great story” he said “You see that’s what punishment does when you use it with  somebody  who  lacks  confidence  or  is  insecure  because  of  lack  of  experience  If inexperienced  people  don’t  perform  that  is  do what  you  want  them  to  do then  rather than  punish  them  we  need  to  go  back  to  One  Minute  Goal  Setting  and  make  sure  they understand  what  is  expected  of  them  and  that  they  have  seen  what  good  performance looks like” “Well  then  after  you  have  done  One  Minute  Goal  Setting  again”  the  young  man asked “do you try to catch them doing something approximately right again” “Precisely  so”  the  One  Minute  Manager  agreed  “You’re  always  trying  to  create situations in the beginning where you can give a One Minute Praising” Then looking the young  man  straight  in  the  eyes  the  manager  said  “You  are  a  very  enthusiastic  and receptive  learner  That  makes  me  feel  good  about  sharing  the  secrets  of  One  Minute Management with you” They both smiled They knew a One Minute Praising when they heard one “I sure enjoy a praising more than a reprimand” the young man laughed “I  think  I  understand  now  why  One  Minute  Goals  and  One  Minute  Praisings  work They really do make good sense to me” “Good” said the One Minute Manager “But  I  can’t  imagine  why  the  One  Minute  Reprimand  works”  the  young  man wondered out loud “Let me tell you a few things about it” said the One Minute Manager 47 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER Why One Minute Reprimands Work “THERE are several reasons why the One Minute Reprimand works so well “To begin with” the manager explained “the feedback in the One Minute Reprimand is immediate That is you get to the individual as soon as you observe the ‘misbehavior’ or your data information system tips you off It is not appropriate to gunnysack or save up negative feelings about someone’s poor performance “The  fact  that  the  feedback  is  so  immediate  is  an  important  lesson  in  why  the  One Minute Reprimand works so well Unless discipline occurs as close to the misbehavior as possible  it tends  not to be as  helpful  in  influencing  future behavior Most  managers are ‘gunnysack’  discipliners  That  is  they  store  up  observations  of  poor  behavior  and  then some day when performance review comes or they are angry in general because the ‘sack is  so  full’  they  charge  in  and  ‘dump  everything  on  the  table’  They  tell  people  all  the things they have done wrong for the last few weeks or months or more” The young man breathed a deep sigh and said “So true” “And then” the One Minute Manager went on “the manager and subordinate usually end  up  yelling  at  each  other  about the  facts or  simply  keeping  quiet  and resenting  each other  The  person  receiving  the  feedback  doesn’t  really  hear  what  he  or  she  has  done wrong This is a version of the ‘leave alonezap’ form of discipline that I’ve spoken about earlier” “I remember it well” responded the young man “That is certainly something I want to avoid” “Absolutely”  agreed  the  manager  “If  managers  would  only  intervene  early  they could deal with one behavior at a time and the person receiving the discipline would not be overwhelmed They could  hear the feedback That’s why I think performance review is an ongoing process not something you do only once a year” “So one reason that the One Minute Reprimand works is that the person receiving the reprimand can ‘hear’ the feedback because when the manager deals with one behavior at a time it seems more fair and clear” the young man summarized “Yes”  the  manager  said  “And  secondly  when  I  give  a  One  Minute  Reprimand  I never attack a person’s worth or value as a person Since their OKness as a person is not ‘up  for grabs’ they don’t feel they  have to defend themselves I reprimand the  behavior only  Thus  my  feedback  and  their  own reaction  to it  is  about the  specific  behavior  and not their feelings about themselves as human beings “So often  when  disciplining  people  managers  persecute  the  individual  My  purpose in a One Minute Reprimand is to eliminate the behavior and keep the person” “So that’s why you make the second half of the reprimand a praising” the young man said “Their behavior is not OK They are OK” “Yes” agreed the One Minute Manager “Why  wouldn’t  you  give  the  praising  first  and  then  the  reprimand”  suggested  the young man “For some reason it just doesn’t work” insisted the manager “Some people now that I think  of  it  say  that  I  am  Nice  ’n’  Tough  as  a  manager  But to  be  more  accurate  I’m really Tough ’n’ Nice” 48 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “Tough ’n’ Nice” echoed the young man “Yes”  insisted the One Minute Manager “This is an old philosophy that has worked well for literally thousands of years “There  is  in  fact  a  story  in  ancient China  that  illustrates  this  Once  upon  a time an emperor appointed a second in command He called this prime minister in and in effect said to him  Why don’t we divide up the tasks  Why don’t you do all the punishing and I’ll do all the rewarding The prime minister said  Fine I’ll do all the punishing and you do all the rewarding” “I think I’m going to like this story” the young man said “You will you will” the One Minute Manager replied with a knowing smile “Now  this  emperor”  the  manager  continued  “soon  noticed  that  whenever  he  asked someone  to  do  something  they  might do it  or they  might  not do  it  However when  the prime  minister  spoke  people  moved  So the  emperor  called  the  prime  minister  back  in and  said  Why  don’t  we  divide  the  tasks  again  You  have  been  doing  all  the  punishing here  for  quite  a  while  Now  let  me  do  the  punishing  and  you  do  the  rewarding  So  the prime minister and the emperor switched roles again “And within a  month the prime  minister was emperor The emperor had  been a nice person  rewarding  and  being  kind to everyone then  he  started to  punish  people  People said  What’s wrong with that old codger and they threw him out on his ear When they came  to  look  for  a  replacement  they  said  You  know  who’s  really  starting  to  come around nowthe prime minister So they put him right into office” “Is that a true story” the young man asked “Who  cares”  said  the  One  Minute  Manager  laughing  “Seriously”  he  added  “I  do know  this  If  you  are  first  tough  on  the  behavior  and   then  supportive  of  the  person  it works” “Do  you  have  any  modernday  examples  of  where  the  One  Minute  Reprimand  has worked other than in management” the young man asked the wise manager “Yes  certainly”  the  manager  said  “Let  me  mention  two  one  with  severe  adult behavior problems and another in disciplining children” “What do you mean when you say ‘severe adult behavior problems’” the young man asked “I’m  talking  about  alcoholics  in  particular”  the  manager  answered  “About  thirty years  ago  an  observant  clergyman  discovered  a  technique  which  is  now  called  ‘crisis intervention’ He made the discovery when he was helping a physician’s wife She was in a  Minnesota  hospital  in  critical  condition  and  slowly  dying  from  cirrhosis  of  the  liver But  she  was  still  denying  that  she  had  a  drinking  problem  When  all  her  family  had gathered at her  bedside the clergyman asked each of them to describe specific drinking incidents  they  had  observed  That’s  an  important  part  of  the  One  Minute  Reprimand Before  giving  a  reprimand  you  have to  see the behavior  yourselfyou  can’t  depend  on what someone else saw You never give a reprimand based on ‘hearsay’ ” “Interesting” the young man broke in “Let  me  finish  After  the  family  described  specific  behaviors  the  clergyman  asked each  of  the  family  members  to  tell  the  woman  how  they  felt  about  those  incidents Gathered closely around her one by one they told her first what she  did and second how they  felt about it They were angry frustrated embarrassed And then they told  her how 49 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER much they loved her and they instinctively touched her and gently said how they wanted her to live and to enjoy life once again That was why they were so angry with her” “That  sounds  so  simple”  said  the  young  man  “especially  with  something  as complicated as a drinking problem Did it work” “Amazingly  so”  the  One  Minute  Manager  insisted  “And  now  there  are  crisis intervention  centers  all  over  the  country  It’s  not  as  simple  as  I’ve  summarized  it  of course  But  these  three  basic  ingredientstelling  people  what  they  did  wrong  telling people  how  you  feel  about  it  and  reminding  people  that  they  are  valuable  and worthwhilelead to significant improvements in people’s behavior” “That’s nothing short of incredible” the young man said “I know it is” the manager agreed “You said you’d give me two examples of how other people successfully use methods like the One Minute Reprimand” the young man said “Yes of course In the early 1970’s a family psychiatrist in California also made the same amazing discovery with children He had read a  lot about bondingthe emotional ties  people  have  to  people  He  knew  what  people  needed  People  need  to  be  in  contact with  people  who  care  about  themto  be  accepted  as  valuable  just  because  they  are people “The doctor also knew that people need to have a spade called a spadeto be pulled up short by people who care when they are not behaving well” “How does that translate” the young man wanted to know “into practical action” “Each  parent  is  taught  to  physically  touch  their  child  by  putting  their  hand  on  the child’s shoulder touching his arm or if he is young actually sitting the child in their lap Then the parent tells the child exactly what he did wrong and how the parent feels about itand  in  no  uncertain  terms  You  can  see  that  this  is  very  like  what  the  family members did for the sick woman Finally the parent takes a deep breath and allows for a few  seconds  of  silenceso the  child  can   feel whatever  the  parent  is  feeling  Then  the parent tells the youngster how valuable and important the child is to the parent “You  see  it  is  very  important  when  you  are  managing  people  to  remember  that behavior  and  worth  are  not  the  same  things  What  is  really  worthwhile  is  the   person managing their own behavior This is as true of each of us as managers as it is of each of the people we are managing “In  fact  if  you  know  this”  the  manager  said  as  he  pointed  to  one  of  his  favorite plaques “you will know the key to a really successful reprimand 50 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER ê We Are Not Just Our Behavior We Are The Person Managing Our Behavior ê 51 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “If  you realize that  you are  managing people and not  just their recent behavior” the manager concluded “you will do well” “It sounds like there’s a lot of caring and respect behind such a reprimand” the young man said “I’m  glad  you  noticed  that  young  man You  will be  successful with  the  One Minute Reprimand when you really care about the welfare of the person you are reprimanding” “That  reminds  me”  the  young  man  injected  “Mr Levy  told  me that  you  pat  him  on the  shoulder  or  shake  hands  or  in  some  other  way  make  contact  with  him  during  a praising And now I notice that the parents are encouraged to touch their children during the  scolding  Is  touching  an  important  part  of  the  One  Minute  Praisings  and Reprimands” “Yes and no” the manager answered with a smile “Yes if you know the person well and are clearly interested in helping the person to succeed in his or her work And no if you or the other person has any doubts about that “Touch  is  a  very  powerful  message”  the  manager  pointed  out  “People  have  strong feelings  about  being  touched  and  that  needs  to  be  respected  Would  you  for  instance like  someone  whose  motives  you  weren’t  sure  of  to  touch  you  during  a  praising  or  a reprimand” “No” the young man answered clearly “I really wouldn’t” “You see what I  mean” the  manager explained “Touch  is  very  honest People know immediately when you touch them whether you care about them or whether you are just trying to find a new way to manipulate them “There  is  a  very  simple  rule  about  touching”  the  manager  continued  “When  you touch  don’t  take  Touch  the  people  you  manage  only  when  you  are   giving  them somethingreassurance support encouragement whatever” “So you should refrain from touching someone” the young man said “until you know them and they know you are interested in their successthat you are clearly on their side I can see that “But”  the  young  man  said  hesitantly  “while  the  One  Minute  Praisings  and  the  One Minute Reprimands look simple enough aren’t they really just powerful ways for you to get people to do what you want them to do And isn’t that manipulative” “You are right about One Minute Management being a powerful way to get people to do what you want them to do” the manager confirmed “However manipulation is getting people to do something they are either  not aware of or   don’t  agree  to  That  is  why  it  is  so  important to  let  each person  know  up  front what you are doing and why “It’s  like  anything  else  in  life”  the  manager  explained  “There  are  things  that  work and  things  that  don’t  work  Being  honest  with  people  eventually  works  On  the  other hand as you have probably learned in your own life being dishonest eventually leads to failing with people It’s just that simple” “I  can  see  now”  the  young  man  said  “where  the  power  of  your  management  style comes fromyou care about people” “Yes” the manager said simply “I guess I do” The young man remembered how gruff he thought this special manager was when he first met him 52 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER It was as though the manager could read his mind “Sometimes”  the  One  Minute  Manager  said  “you  have  to  care  enough  to  be  tough And I am I am very tough on the poor performancebut only on the performance I am never tough on the person” The  young  man  liked  the  One  Minute  Manager  He  knew  now  why  people  liked  to work with him “Maybe  you would  find this  interesting Sir” the  younger  man said as  he pointed to his  notebook  “It  is  a  plaque  I’ve  created  to  remind  me  of  how   goalsthe  One  Minute Goalsand   consequencesthe  Praisings  and  the  Reprimandsaffect  people’s behavior” 53 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER ê Goals Begin Behaviors Consequences Maintain Behaviors ê 54 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “That’s very good” the manager exclaimed “Do you think so” the young man asked wanting to hear the compliment once again “Young man” the manager said very slowly for emphasis “it is not my role in life to be a human tape recorder I do not have time to continually repeat myself” Just  when  he  thought  he  would  be praised  the  young  man  felt  he  was  in  for another One Minute Reprimand something he wanted to avoid The bright young man kept a straight face and said simply “What” They looked at each other only for a moment and then they both burst into laughter “I like you young man” the manager said “How would you like to go to work here” The  young  man  put  down  his  notebook  and  stared  in  amazement  “You  mean  go  to work for you” he asked enthusiastically “No I mean go to work for yourself like the other people in my department Nobody ever really works for anybody else I just help people work better and in the process they benefit our organization” This was of course what the young man had been looking for all along “I’d love to work here” he said And so he didfor some time The  time  the  special  manager  had  invested  in  him  paid  off  Because  eventually  the inevitable happened 55 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER ê HE became a One Minute Manager ê 56 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER He became a One Minute Manager not because he thought like one or talked like one but because he behaved like one He set One Minute Goals He gave One Minute Praisings He gave One Minute Reprimands He  asked  brief  important  questions  spoke  the  simple  truth  laughed  worked  and enjoyed And  perhaps  most  important of all  he encouraged  the  people  he  worked  with  to do the same He had even created a pocket size “Game Plan” to make it easier for the people around him to become One Minute Managers He had given it as a useful gift to each person who reported to him 57 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER A Gift To Yourself MANY  years  later  the  man  looked  back  on  the  time  when  he  first  heard  of  the principles  of  One  Minute  Management  It  seemed  like  a  long  time ago He  was  glad  he had written down what he learned from the One Minute Manager He had put his notes into a book and had given copies to many people He  remembered  Ms  Gomez’s  telephoning  to  say  “I  can’t  thank  you  enough  It’s made a big difference in my work” That pleased him As he thought back on the past he smiled He remembered how much he had learned from the original One Minute Manager and he was grateful The  new  manager was also  happy that  he could take the knowledge one  step  further By  giving  copies  to  many  other  people  in  the  organization  he  had  solved  several practical problems Everyone  who  worked  with  him  felt  secure  No  one  felt  manipulated  or  threatened because everyone knew “up front” what he was doing and why They could also see  why the seemingly simple One Minute Management techniques Goals Praising and Reprimandsworked so well with people Every person who had their own copy of the text could read and reread it at their own pace until they could understand it and put it to good use themselves The manager knew full well the very practical advantage of repetition in learning anything new Sharing the knowledge in this simple and honest way had of course saved him a good deal of time And it had certainly made his job easier Many  of  the  people  reporting  to him  had  become  One  Minute  Managers  themselves And they in turn had done the same for many of the people who reported to them The entire organization had become more effective As he sat at his desk thinking the new One Minute Manager realized what a fortunate individual he was He had given himself the gift of getting greater results in less time He had time to think and to planto give his organization the kind of help it needed He had time to exercise and stay healthy He knew he did not experience the daily emotional and physical stress other managers subjected themselves to And  he  knew  that  many  of  the  other people who worked  with  him  enjoyed  the  same benefits His  department  had  fewer  costly  personnel  turnovers  less  personal  illness  and  less absenteeism The benefits were significant As  he  looked  back  he  was  glad  he  had  not  waited  to  use  One  Minute  Management until he thought he could do it  just right After his staff had read about this management system he had asked each person who reported to him if they would like to be managed by a One Minute Manager He was amused to learn that there was something that people  really wanted even more than  learning  how  to  become  a  One  Minute Manager  themselves  And that  was   to have one for a boss Once  he  knew  this  it  was  a  lot  easier  for  him  to  clearly  tell  his  staff  that  he  wasn’t sure that he could do it just exactly the way he was “supposed to” 58 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER “I’m not accustomed to telling people how good they are or how I feel about things” he had said “And I’m not sure I can remember to calm down after I’ve given someone a reprimand and reminded them of how good they are as a person” The typical  answer  from  his associates had caused him to smile “Well you could at least give it a  try” By simply asking if his staff wanted to be managed by a One Minute Manager and by admitting that he  may  not always  be able to do it right he had accomplished  something very important The  people  he  worked  with  felt  that  he  was  honestly  on  their  side  from  the  very beginning And  that made all the difference Then the new One Minute Manager got up from his desk and began to walk about his uncluttered office He was deep in thought He felt good about himselfas a person and as a manager His  caring  about  people  had  paid  off  handsomely  He  had  risen  in  the  organization gaining more responsibilities and more rewards And he knew he had become an effective manager because both his organization and the people in it had clearly benefited from his presence 59 Kenneth Blanchard  Spenser Johnson – THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER A Gift For Others SUDDENLY the intercom buzzed and startled the man “Excuse me sir for interrupting you” he heard his secretary say “but there is a young woman on the phone She wants to know if she can come and talk to you about the way we manage people here” The new One Minute Manager was pleased He knew more women were entering the business  world  And  he  was  glad  that  some  of  them  were  as  keen  to  learn  about  good management as he had been The  manager’s  department  was  now  running  smoothly  As  you  might  expect  it  was one of the best operations of its kind in the world His people were productive and happy And he was happy too It felt good to be in his position “Come any time” he heard himself telling the caller And  soon  he  found  himself  talking  to  a  bright  young  person  “I’m  glad  to  share  my management  secrets  with  you”  the  new  One  Minute  Manager  said  as  he  showed  the visitor to his couch “I will only make one request of you” “What is that” the visitor asked “Simply” the manager began “that you ” 60 Kenneth Blanchard
